# Kinematics

## About The Project
**Description**: This repository contains a kinematics library for the Arduino platform. The library can be used for various robotics projects to solve kinematics equations such as forward kinematics and inverse kinematics. In addition the library provides tools to compute the Jacobian of the system which can further be used to solve velocity kinematics or statics and dynamics equations.

Here is a GIF of the kinematics library being used to control a small scale 6 DOF manipulator arm built using servo motors and 3D printed parts.

## Getting Started
Steps to use the kinematics library in your project:

### Prerequisites
